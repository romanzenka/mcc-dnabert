# mcc-dnabert
Install script to run DNABERT on Mayo Clinic Cloud infrastructure

The way MCC is set up is a bit specific, resulting in few minor issues
when following the instructions from the DNABERT website.

The purpose of this repo is to pool knowledge about workarounds
so everyone does not have to struggle with the same issues
and duplicate effort resolving them.
